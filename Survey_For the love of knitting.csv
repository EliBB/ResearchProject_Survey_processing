Three most important tools, again, meaningless answer. You need what you need. You can't knit without the needles, so I ticked them. But if you want something to fit, you also need a tape measure. If you want cables, a cable needle. If you want to finish your work, scissors and sewing needles. Every tool has its purpose; some, you can improvise, some not.

I can't imagine one replacing my physical tools for everyday use.

When I had a tablet, the ability to annotate the digital copy of a pattern and share that across my devices was still very useful (inconvenient as my small phone screen is by comparison, it works in a pinch.) I had to download and upload using Google Drive, so building in a file access system to make for seamless syncing across devices would certainly be great (but there are apps like Evernote that already specialize in that.)

To address even my skill level, a library of video tutorials would need to be encyclopedic, which seems beyond the scope of general-use software. There are also lots of very good beginner tutorials, so directing users to those would seem a better use of resources unless the goal is an all-inclusive app.","Good luck on your project!
